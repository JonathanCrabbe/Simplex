# SimplEx - Explaining Latent Representations with a Corpus of Examples
![image](simplex_examples.png "Examples of SimplEx explanations")

Code Author: Jonathan Crabb√© ([jc2133@cam.ac.uk](mailto:jc2133@cam.ac.uk))

This repository contains the implementation of SimplEx, a method to explain the latent
representations of black-box models with the help of a corpus of examples.
For more details, please read our [NeurIPS 2021 paper](LINK): 'Explaining Latent Representations with a Corpus of Examples'.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a new virtual environment with Python 3.8
3. Run the following command from the repository folder:
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt #install requirements
    ```
When the packages are installed, SimplEx can directly be used.

## Toy example

Bellow, you can find a toy demonstration where we make a corpus decomposition of test examples representations.
All the relevant code can be found in the file [simplex](explainers/simplex.py).

```python
from explainers.simplex import Simplex
from models.base import BlackBox

# Get the model and the examples
model = BlackBox() # Model should have the BlackBox interface
corpus_inputs = get_corpus() # A tensor of corpus inputs
test_inputs = get_test() # A set of inputs to explain

# Compute the corpus and test latent representations
corpus_latents = model.latent_representation(corpus_inputs) 
test_latents = model.latent_representation(test_inputs)

# Initialize SimplEX, fit it on test examples
simplex = Simplex(corpus_examples=corpus_inputs, 
                  corpus_latent_reps=corpus_latents)
simplex.fit(test_examples=test_inputs, 
            test_latent_reps=test_latents,
            reg_factor=0)

# Get the weights of each corpus decomposition
weights = simplex.weights
```
We get a tensor weights that can be interpreted as follows:
``weights[i,c] = weight of corpus example c in the decomposition of example i``.

We can get the importance of each corpus feature for the decomposition 
of a given example ``i`` in the following way:
```python
# Compute the Integrated Jacobian for a particular example
i = 42
input_baseline = get_baseline() # Baseline tensor of the same shape as corpus_inputs
simplex.jacobian_projections(test_id=i, model=model,
                             input_baseline=input_baseline)

result = simplex.decompose(i)
```
We get a list ``result`` where each element of the list corresponds to a corpus example.
This list is sorted by decreasing order of importance in the corpus decomposition.
Each element of the list is a tuple structured as follows:
```python
w_c, x_c, proj_jacobian_c = result[c]
```
Where ``w_c`` corresponds to the weight ``weights[i,c]``, ``x_c`` corresponds to ``corpus_inputs[c]``
and ``proj_jacobian`` is a tensor such that ``proj_jacobian_c[k]`` is the Projected Jacobian 
of feature ``k`` from corpus example ``c``.
